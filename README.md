## Hey there , I'm Rayhona 
I'm passionate  Frontend Developer in the making, currently learning the art of creating cool websites and interfaces. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my tools, and every day is an opportunity  to build something new and awesome.

## What am I up to?
I'm all about designing responsive and user-friendly websites  that are both beautiful and functional. Right now, I'm diving into:
- HTML & CSS (Mastering layouts and designs)
- JavaScript (Adding interactivity and magic)
- Git & GitHub (Because version control is life)

## My Dream
I dream of working at IT Park and being a part of a team that shapes the future with innovative technology. I also want to inspire others  to explore coding and tech.
